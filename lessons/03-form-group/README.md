# Accessible Cross-Browser Forms

## `03-form-group`

We'll make a starting point for our form layout styles by creating .form-group which will add a bit of margin between fields. This will be our first design system component, so we'll also include styles for the label contained in this class.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Generate minified, autoprefixed CSS for production
