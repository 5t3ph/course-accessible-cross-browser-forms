# Accessible Cross-Browser Forms

## `08-select-styles`

Using modern CSS and in particular `clip-path` we can define cross-browser compatible custom select CSS styles inclusive of the dropdown arrow. We'll continue ensuring all styles are re-themeable by using the Sass functions we've already created within our form design system. We will style both the default single select, and a multi-select using `multiple`.
