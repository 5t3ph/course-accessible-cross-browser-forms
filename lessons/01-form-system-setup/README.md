# Accessible Cross-Browser Forms

## `01-form-system-setup`

In this lesson we'll create the basic styles for our project, including setting up Sass helpers for our form design system. We'll learn how to use the !default flag to allow our system to be easily overwritten project to project, making our form styles ultra reusable. You'll also learn how to leverage Sass color functions for ease of theming.
