# Accessible Cross-Browser Forms

## `07-form-field`

In this lesson, we'll begin to apply our theme styles for our text inputs by creating the `.form-field` component. We'll make use of the Sass feature of "mixins" to create `:focus` and `:disabled` styles that can be reused. While creating the `:focus` and `:disabled` states we'll discuss the importance of contrast for accessibility.
